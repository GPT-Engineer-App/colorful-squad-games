# colorful-squad-games

So we are creating a website that is a game website. In this website you have an option of playing in a square grid game, a blue or red game side, and a team vs team random color side. Upon entering the website you will be given these 4 options and whichever you choose you will go into that game. First game is the grid game which is 1 big square and the user will input how many player there are and based on that number that many squares will be made inside, after the square are made the user will have the option to input a letter in that square. Once all squares are filled the user will have the option to start. the game will begin. The computer will randomly lighting up each box a red square going around the square, depending on how many players there are the computer will elimate enough square so that there is always 4 rounds with the 4th round being the winner square OR the last one standing. game 2 is the red or blue, were the user chose there side based on the question, user can input a question before the game starts or the computer can provide random would you rather questions on a category of choice, depending on how many question were typed in or if the user chose the computer option it will also be asked to chose how many rounds, at the end of the game the color with the most point the screen will turn that color and say TEAM (color) WINS, on every game on every endgame screen there will be a button option that will allow users to go back to the main screen with all the game options. game 3 is a color majority vote. players will be divided into even teams, after teams will read a question either user typed questions so before give an option to type user own questions or trivia style questions based on different categories they get to choose, The question will pop up then teams will be given a time amount chosen by user have it be 15, 20, 25,30 seconds. After question is shown timer will begin and answer will be shown. teams will all have a vote and the most voted answer gets chosen. depending on how many question were typed in or if the user chose the computer option it will also be asked to chose how many rounds, at the end of the game the color with the most point the screen will turn that color and say TEAM (color) WINS. Game 4 will be a guess the number to the vault game, Everyday players will be able to enter the game and guess a random digit that is the number used in a random fact. This number will open the vault and display the fact of the day assuming you guess the all the digits, So for example today the number could be 1,178. The user will have the ability to guess 1 less then the amount of numbers in the fact of the day so if there is 4 numbers it will be 3 tries, when the user guess the digit correct that digit will turn green and lock. the rest of the wrong number will remain able to change assuming there are tries still left. If all digits are correct and tries avaible is above 0 user will win and the vault will open displaying inside the fact of the day which contained that number example "The Did you know the longest street in the world is Yonge street in Toronto Canada measuring 1,178 miles".
